# My Component Library

This is a component library built using react components that utilizes a Storybook library. Each component in the library can be edited by changing the values of the properties when the component is invoked. There are 3 types of components (Buttons, Forms, and Advertisements). Each of these types has multiple child components showcasing many examples.
